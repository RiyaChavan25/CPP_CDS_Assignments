Experiment 5: To Study and Implement C++ Decision Making Statements

ðŸ”¹ Aim
To understand and implement various decision-making constructs in C++ such as `if`, `if-else`, `nested if-else`, and `switch-case`.

ðŸ”¹ Programs

1. Even or Odd
[`EvenOrOdd.cpp`](./EvenOrOdd.cpp)  

2. Largest of Three Numbers
[`LargestOfThree.cpp`](./LargestOfThree.cpp)  

3. Vowel or Consonant Check
[`CheckVowel.cpp`](./CheckVowel.cpp)  

4. Movie Rating using Switch Case
[`MovieRating.cpp`](./MovieRating.cpp)  

5. Calculator using Switch Case
[`Calculator.cpp`](./Calculator.cpp)  

ðŸ”¹ Observation
Each program compiled successfully and produced correct outputs for different test inputs. The decision-making statements were used effectively to direct program flow based on conditions.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion
Decision-making statements in C++ allow programs to make logical choices and respond to different inputs dynamically. This experiment reinforced the usage of `if`, `if-else`, and `switch-case` in real-world scenarios.
